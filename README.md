 Calculators are fun, so, to begin with, we will build a simple Calculator using JavaScript. We’ll utilize fundamental JavaScript functions to make all the components work, as well as simple HTML and CSS. We’ll use HTML to display buttons and numbers, and CSS to make them more appealing. Furthermore, we’ll utilize JavaScript.
